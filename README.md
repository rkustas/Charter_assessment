# **Covid-19**

## **Background**
This is an evaluation of a Covid-19 dataset that has been provided by a [repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Bing-COVID-19-Data) from [Bing's](https://www.bing.com/covid/local/unitedstatesa) Covid-19 tracker.  There is also a very informative [widget](https://github.com/microsoft/COVID-19-Widget) that you can embed into your website.
## **Objectives**
- Evaluate Deaths and Confirmed Cases worldwide then specifically in the United States according to this dataset.
- Determine if there are some conclusions this data can provide.
- Utilize tools such as Tableau, Pandas, Python and SQL.

Finished Tableau notebook is [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ryan4454#!/vizhome/Covid_results/CovidStory)

## **Process**
### **Jupyter Notebook, Python and Pandas**
---
1.  I first created a Jupyter notebook and evaluated what the data looked like and if there needed to be transformations done to columns.
2.  Replaced NA values where I could, changed data types to prep for database insertion and then exported a copy of the file to a csv.
3.  I created 3 python files to try and load the dataset to MySQL however there was an issue with my connect file and I kept getting an error with the database loading an options file that it shouldn't have.  The statement my function was failing on was:


        `load_sql = """LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/Covid-19.csv' INTO TABLE covid.raw_data FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' IGNORE 1 LINES;"""
`

4.  I spent hours trying to take care of this but just decided a work around was to use SQLAlchemy in the jupyter notebook environment.

### **SQL Alchemy**
1.  Created a connection string and engine and then loaded the data into a table called covid with some vanilla SQLAlchemy:

        engine = create_engine(f"mysql+pymysql://{user}:{pw}@localhost/covid")

        # Declare Base
        Base = declarative_base()

        # Create ORMs
        class Covid(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'covid'
        
        ID = Column(Integer,primary_key=True)
        Updated = Column(Date)
        Confirmed = Column(Integer)
        Deaths = Column(Float)
        DeathsChange = Column(Float)
        Recovered = Column(Float)
        RecoveredChange = Column(Float)
        Latitude = Column(Float)
        Longitude = Column(Float)
        ISO2 =Column(Text)
        ISO3 = Column(Text)
        Country_Region = Column(Text)
        AdminRegion1 = Column(Text)
        AdminRegion2 = Column(Text)
        
            def __repr__(self):
            return f"id={self.ID}, name={self.covid}"

        # Create tables
        Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

        # List table names
        engine.table_names()
2.  Then I passed a function:

        # Function to add the data from a csv file
        def populate_table(engine,table,csvfile):
        conn = engine.connect()
        df_to_insert = pd.read_csv(csvfile)
        data = df_to_insert.to_dict(orient='records')
        conn.execute(table.delete())
        conn.execute(table.insert(),data)
        
3.  Ran a query to test:

        engine.execute("SELECT * FROM covid LIMIT 10").fetchall()
---

### **mySQL**
1.  Queried the database for preliminiary analysis.  Checking if the total rows matched what the CSV showed and if all data looked like I wanted it to look.

2.  Please see the attached SQL file [here](https://github.com/rkustas/Charter_assessment/tree/master/sql)

---
### **Tableau**
1.  I connected mySQL to Tableau Desktop by passing in my credentials and a SQL statment that encapsulated the whole table.
2.  I then evaluated Covid-19 within Tableau Desktop looking for trends in data and visually display what was happening with this pandemic.
3.  The workbook can be seen publically [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ryan4454#!/vizhome/Covid_results/CovidStory).

- Webpage with embedded Tableau workbook with further analysis.
- Supervised machine learning via Scikit Learn, Python and Pandas.
- Real-time data pulling via REST API
- Deep statistical analysis.
